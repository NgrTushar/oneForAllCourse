# OneForAllCourse

A comprehensive repository showcasing examples in Rust, C++, Node.js, React, and Web3. This project is designed to help you learn by example, covering various topics and providing practical code snippets for each.

**Note:** If some folders or code are missing, they will be added soon. This repository will continually expand with more code and examples, making it useful not just for beginners but also for anyone looking to brush up on concepts or learn something new.

Each code file includes detailed comments explaining the functionality line-by-line using `//` tags. This is a crucial feature of the repository, ensuring that you not only see how the code works but also understand why it works that way. If you comprehend what the code does, you can think more critically and creatively when writing your own code.

## Repository Structure

### Rust Examples (`rustex`)

- Covers fundamental and advanced topics in Rust with clear code examples.
- Organized into modules like concurrency, error handling, iterators, and more.

### C++ Examples (`cppex`)

- Demonstrates C++ concepts from basic syntax to advanced DSA implementations.
- DSA-focused folder showcasing common algorithms and data structures.

### Node.js Examples (`nodex`)

- Provides backend solutions with Node.js, focusing on API development, middleware, and more.

### React Examples (`reactex`)

- Frontend projects using React, recommended to be set up with Vite.
- Includes `.odt` documentation files for explanations (best viewed with LibreOffice for compatibility).

### Web3 Code (`web3ex`)

- Blockchain-focused code, showing both Rust and Node.js implementations for similar tasks.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oneForAllCourse.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd rustex   # or cppex, nodex, reactex, web3ex
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**

   - **Rust:**
     ```bash
     rustc filename.rs && ./filename
     ```
   - **C++:**
     ```bash
     g++ filename.cpp -o filename && ./filename
     ```
   - **Node.js:**
     ```bash
     node filename.js
     ```
   - **React:**
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

**Platform Notice:** Adjust compilation commands and file access according to your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux). `.odt` files are best opened with LibreOffice for full compatibility.
