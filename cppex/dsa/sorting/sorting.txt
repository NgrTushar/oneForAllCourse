There are two types of algorithm stable and unstable 
stable algorithm not only sorts the array in right order but also ensure that if two 
elements have same value then it also sorts while considering multiple fields.
stabilty is not important if you are sorting integer array. 
stability is important when you consider it sorting by one field, two field or three fields
example stable sort: Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort..
Unstable sort: Selection Sort ,Quick Sort ,Heap Sort..
Bubble sort- it only swaps adjacent elements when array i is greater than array i+1 then 
it swaps if array i is smaller or equal to array i+1 then it does not do anything 
that means if two same items appear one after the other then it does not going to swap  

Selection Sort- it finds maximum element in the array then it swaps maximum element with the last element in the array so it unstable
