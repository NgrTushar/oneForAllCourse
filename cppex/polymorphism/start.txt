POLYMORPHISM
// declaration;

a person has assigned task to multiple people to get his task done 
task-
1. purchase milk - Ram 
2. purchase veggies  - Shyam
3. purchase clothes - Sita 

As of now person has to remember every person name and tasks he assigned to them 
right now which person to call is very task specific 

condition of polymorphism in this example:
1. existence of a process in many forms 
2. which form gets executed first should depend on input
3. all the forms should reside in single unit 
Conclusion: Not all three conditions are being satisfied in this example

Solution: Do something , so that all forms can reside in a single form 
--: Overload the information in a single unit

Follow up--:

a person should assign all the task to a single person and then he just needs to remember single person name and then task will get done without having to remember different names for different task-
1. Bharti- purchase milk,purchase veggies, purchase clothes.

this is the example of polymorphism.
