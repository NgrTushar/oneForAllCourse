classes may have resources like:-> pointer, file handle, socket, thread etc.
These resources may be defined in the constructor
Sometimes we need to decide If these resources must be COPIED or MOVED or DESTROYED.
Eg. On Destruction of an object the resource must be release which is important to avoid  Leaks. :: Deletion of pointer is either explicit or lifetime bound object by smart pointer.
Similarly, while Copying of an object or moving of an object; need to decide how that     object must be handled.

For such classes we need to implement the Rule Of Five.
While takng, Ownership  of resources then you should take responsibility to clean up the  resources.
Must provide ::-> Destructor, Copy Constructor, Copy Constructor Operator, Move Constructor, Move Constructor Operator. (To ensure the proper handling of an object)
Eg. If a resource is pointer to heap based memory then we  should allocate New memory and then copy the value in a newly allocated memory.

In move assignment we need to move underlying resource from one object to another.
Rule of 0::->
compiler will synthesis it automatically neccessary functions.
