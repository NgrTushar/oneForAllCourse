State -
it is just an Javascript object  that represents the current state of the
application, it represents the things which are dynamic in your application 
(things that change) 
example the value of the counter in the simple webpage where when you click 
counter button, its counter value increases by one 
the state variable will the number not the whole thing( i.e. Counter 5 - 5 
represents the state here) 
so the state will be look like -
{
    count:1
}
example of linkedin- the topbar of the application where the number represents
the state which will change as soon as state gets updated 
{
topbar:{
home:0,
myNetwork:"99+",
jobs:0,
messaging:0,
notification:12,
}
}
the way react is written is when you change the jobs counter to 2 then
it will automatically put a notification to 2, if you change myNetwork to 5
then react will automcatically will replace the 99+ from 5.
on button click the counter needs to go up that will happen in state
but how that happens will defined in components

Components-
How a DOM element should render, given a state 
it is reusable dynamic 
the state change triggers a re-render a re-render represents actual DOM
being manipulate when the state changes 
only once you need to define your components then all you have to do is 
update the state react take care of re-rendering your app 
a Javascript Components does not return HTML but returns xml
